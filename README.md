## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - React component library
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Overall was a shorter one, didn't get too detail about stuff, just wanted a quick thing done. 

- Learnt abit about how the hsl color scheme works. Was useful when I wanted to darken colors.
- Found two really useful hooks in Chakra UI,  [useToken](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/hooks/use-token) and [useMediaQuery](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/hooks/use-media-query). **useMediaQuery** enabled me to do css-esque media query stuff with js, while **useToken** was just useful to get different shades of colors and pass them into jsx.


### Useful resources

- [The Software House](https://tsh.io/blog/why-should-you-use-hsl-color-representation-in-css/) - Really quick read on HSL and how they work.
